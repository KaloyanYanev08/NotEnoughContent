This is my school project and a website I was told to make so I decided to join both.
I can't say that I made the whole thing alone, because ther were some things I had to rely on Chat GPT for like setting some stuff up while I still had no idea what I was doing.
This took a while to make and I am tired as hell because I've been sitting in my chair for 8 hours today only.
